# cf-workers-template
This is just a simple Cloudflare Workers template which I use for my projects.

## Scripts
- `build` - builds the project, you should not run this manually
- `dev` - runs the project locally in development mode
- `tunnel` - creates a Cloudflare Tunnel which is used in pair with the dev script to proxy the worker
